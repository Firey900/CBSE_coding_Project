        <h3>
            An open cluster is a type of star cluster made of up to a few thousand stars that were formed from the same giant molecular cloud and have roughly the same age.
            <br><br>
            More than 1,100 open clusters have been discovered within the Milky Way Galaxy, and many more are thought to exist.
            <br><br>
            They are loosely bound by mutual gravitational attraction and become disrupted by close encounters with other clusters and clouds of gas as they orbit the galactic center.
