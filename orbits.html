        <h3>
            an orbit is the gravitationally curved trajectory of an object, such as the trajectory of a planet around a star or a natural satellite around a planet.
            <br><br>
            Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory, although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory.
            <br><br>
            To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits, with the center of mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse.
