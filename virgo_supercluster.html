        <h3>
            The Virgo Supercluster or the Local Supercluster is a mass concentration of galaxies containing the Virgo Cluster and Local Group, which in turn contains the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies.
            <br><br>
            At least 100 galaxy groups and clusters are located within its diameter of 33 megaparsecs (110 million light-years). 
            <br><br>
            The Virgo SC is one of about 10 million superclusters in the observable universe and is in the Piscesâ€“Cetus Supercluster Complex, a galaxy filament.
