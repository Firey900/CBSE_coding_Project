        <h3>
            The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes the Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye.
            <br><br>
            The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin <i>via lactea</i>.
            <br><br>
            The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with an estimated visible diameter of 100,000â€“200,000 light-years.
            <br><br>
            Recent simulations suggest that a <a href="dark_matter.html">dark matter</a> disk, also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of almost 2 million light-years.
            <br><br>
            The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which form part of the Virgo Supercluster, which is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.
