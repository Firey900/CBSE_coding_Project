            Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 88 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.
            <br><br>
            It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals. 
            <br><br>
            Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets about 1‚ÅÑ30 degree. Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System.
